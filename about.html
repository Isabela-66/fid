    <!-- YOUR PERSONAL STORY -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Why I Created This Academy</h2>
        <p>
            Elite England Soccer Academy was created from something deeply personal. After experiencing a 
            serious knee injury that nearly ended my ability to play, I realized how much the sport truly 
            meant to me. Soccer wasn’t just something I did — it was the thing that kept me grounded, 
            motivated, and hopeful during one of the toughest times of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recovering from that injury took time, patience, and mental strength. But through that process,
            I learned something important: <strong>kids and young athletes need a place where they feel 
            supported, encouraged, and reminded why they fell in love with soccer in the first place.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            This academy is built for players who are chasing improvement, for players who might be battling 
            setbacks, and for players who simply need someone to believe in them. My goal is to give young 
            athletes the environment I needed when I was younger — a place full of passion, discipline, 
            positivity, and love for the game.
        </p>

    <!-- OUR STORY -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Elite England Soccer Academy imagines a modern, professional-level training environment located 
            just outside Liverpool. The academy is inspired by the fast-paced, high-standard training methods 
            used across Premier League clubs.
        </p>
        <p>
            We built this program with the intention of making training feel meaningful — not just drills, 
            but sessions that push players mentally, physically, and emotionally. Every player has a 
            different story, and every player deserves a pathway that helps them find their place in the 
            game.
        </p>

    <!-- TRAINING PHILOSOPHY -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Training Philosophy</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> Every session is built to reflect game-like pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Players learn how to think the game, not just play it.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity:</strong> We promote a front-foot, confident, attacking style.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Training ends with reflection and personal notes so players understand their strengths and what 
            to improve next. Growth comes from knowing your game deeply.
