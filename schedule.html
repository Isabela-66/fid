        <h2>Summer Camp in England</h2>
        <p>
            Every July, we imagine running an intense one-week summer camp that offers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two training sessions per day.</li>
            <li>Video analysis evenings with professional match clips.</li>
            <li>Team-building activities and classroom workshops.</li>
            <li>Friendly matches at the end of the week to showcase progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For real inspiration and to explore how top English clubs organise themselves, you can visit
            the official Premier League club list here:

        <h2>What Players Should Bring</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Proper football boots and shin guards.</li>
            <li>Water bottle and light rain jacket (this is England after all!).</li>
            <li>Notebook for writing down feedback and personal goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Being prepared shows professionalism and respect for the game, and it helps players get the
            most out of every session.
