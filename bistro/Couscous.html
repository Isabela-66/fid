  <h1>Couscous Salad with Peas and Mint</h1>
  <p>This is barely a "recipe" since I just threw it together and didn't pay much attention to measurements. 
  But it turned out to be tasty, so I thought I'd share.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 package couscous</li>
    <li>1 can chicken broth (or veggie broth if vegetarian)</li>
    <li>1 to 1/2 cups fresh peas, shelled</li>
    <li>3-4 scallions, sliced thin</li>
    <li>1/4 cup toasted pine nuts</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh mint, chopped</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil (or to taste)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook couscous according to package directions, using chicken broth instead of water. Let cool.</li>
    <li>Boil peas for about 3 minutes until bright green and tender. Rinse in cold water and cool.</li>
    <li>Slice scallions, chop mint, toast pine nuts, and prep any extra veggies.</li>
    <li>Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper to make dressing.</li>
    <li>Toss couscous with peas, mint, scallions, pine nuts, and dressing. Serve right away or chill.</li>
  </ol>
