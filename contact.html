        <h2>Parent & Player Expectations</h2>
        <p>
            We ask that players arrive on time, ready to train, and willing to work hard. Effort is the
            one thing we can all control. Parents are encouraged to support from the sideline in a 
            positive way and allow coaches to guide the session.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, we can create an environment where players feel valued, challenged, and excited
            to come back every week.
