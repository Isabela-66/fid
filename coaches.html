    <!-- COACH 1 -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Coach Ellie Thompson — Former Premier League Academy Midfielder</h2>
        <p>
            Ellie grew up playing in the Liverpool and Manchester youth circuits and earned a place in the 
            <strong>Liverpool Women’s Academy</strong> at age 14. Known for her creativity and sharp 
            decision-making, she captained the U18 squad and trained several times with the senior team.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a knee injury ended her chances of going fully pro, Ellie turned to coaching — a decision
            that shaped her life. She spent four years as a technical development coach within the 
            <strong>Everton Women’s Academy pathway</strong>, helping young midfielders learn how to control 
            the tempo of a match.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ellie believes in teaching players to be brave on the ball: taking risks, scanning early, and 
            creating space with smart movement. Her sessions are fast-paced, demanding, and full of 
            encouragement.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Specialty: attacking play, first touch, combination patterns</li>
            <li>Coached players now in Championship and WSL academies</li>
            <li>Known for her detailed feedback and positive coaching energy</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- COACH 2 -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Coach Marcus Reed — Former Premier League Academy Defender</h2>
        <p>
            Marcus started his journey at <strong>Manchester United’s Academy</strong>, where he played as a 
            centre-back from U9 to U16. Although he didn’t make the senior team, he learned defending from some 
            of the top youth coaches in England.
        </p>
        <p>
            He later signed with a Championship club and played several years in the English Football League. 
            Throughout his time as a player, Marcus was known for his leadership, aerial strength, and ability 
            to organise the back line.
        </p>
        <p>
            After retiring, he worked three seasons as a youth development coach at 
            <strong>Wolverhampton Wanderers</strong>, helping develop young defenders into confident, 
            disciplined players.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Specialty: defensive shape, 1v1 defending, pressing triggers</li>
            <li>Focuses on intelligent positioning and reading the game early</li>
            <li>Teaches players how to stay calm under pressure</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- COACH 3 -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Coach “G” — Premier League-Trained Goalkeeper Developer</h2>
        <p>
            Known simply as “G,” he spent his early career in the 
            <strong>Brighton & Hove Albion Goalkeeping Academy</strong>, where he trained under some of the 
            most respected goalkeeper coaches in the Prem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Injuries prevented him from pushing into the first team, but his talent for analysing movement,
            reading strikers’ body language, and improving a keeper’s reaction speed led him naturally into
            coaching.
        </p>
        <p>
            G has helped develop keepers who went on to join U18 and U21 squads at various professional clubs.
            His sessions are demanding but empowering — focused on confidence, bravery, and modern distribution
            using both feet.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Specialty: shot-stopping, footwork, distribution, 1v1 bravery</li>
            <li>Teaches keepers to become vocal, commanding leaders</li>
            <li>Expert in reading attacking patterns and preparing for tight spaces</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- COACHING PHILOSOPHY -->
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Our Coaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Every coach at Elite England Soccer Academy carries experience from real Premier League academy 
            environments. They understand the standards, the expectations, and the daily habits required to 
            grow as a player.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, they create a training culture built on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Professionalism and respect</li>
            <li>High-intensity training reps</li>
            <li>Bravery in possession and out of possession</li>
            <li>Positive, honest feedback</li>
            <li>Passion for the game and improvement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When players train here, they don’t just learn football — they learn discipline, responsibility,
            and confidence that carries far beyond the pitch.
        </p>
